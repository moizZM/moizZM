##  About Me

I’m currently in my 6th semester of Electronics Engineering at **Hochschule Hamm-Lippstadt (HSHL)**.  
I work as a **Werkstudent in Embedded Hardware at Microsynetics GmbH**, where I design PCBs, develop wearable technologies, and run simulations to optimize embedded systems. My passion lies in bridging hardware with smart functionality to create meaningful, real-world solutions.
