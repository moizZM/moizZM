## About Me  
I’m a **6th-semester Electronics Engineering** student at Hochschule Hamm-Lippstadt (HSHL), currently working as a **Werkstudent in Emaded Hardware**. With hands-on experience in **PCB design**, **3D modeling**, and **sensor integration**, I’m passionate about developing smart wearable tech and embedded systems. I aim to contribute to innovative technologies that solve real-world problems.

##  Projects

###  Autonomous Vehicle (AVR128A)  
> Remote-controlled robot with IR start, HC05 Bluetooth, and ultrasonic avoidance

###  Line Following Robot (Arduino)  
> FSM-based design with C++, SolidWorks prototyping, color sensor actions
> 
### ⚙ Independent Hardware Projects

###  Push Button SMS Alert 
>Raspberry Pi Pico W + Twilio API
>IoT project using the Raspberry Pi Pico W. I connected a simple push button to send SMS alerts through the Twilio API whenever it’s pressed. The system connects to Wi-Fi, and when the button is triggered, it sends a text message to a specified phone number.

###  AND & OR gate using BJTs and MOSFETs  
> Perfboard + PCB layout
>This project was all about understanding transistor logic and solidifying my grasp of circuit design.
>Skills: Soldering · Altium Designer · Electronic Circuit Design · Prototyping
