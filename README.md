##  About Me

I’m currently in my 6th semester of Electronics Engineering at **Hochschule Hamm-Lippstadt (HSHL)**.  
I work as a **Werkstudent in Embedded Hardware at Microsynetics GmbH**, where I design PCBs, develop wearable technologies, and run simulations to optimize embedded systems. My passion lies in bridging hardware with smart functionality to create meaningful, real-world solutions.

## 📁 Projects



###  Autonomous Vehicle (AVR128A)  
> Remote-controlled robot with IR start, HC05 Bluetooth, and ultrasonic avoidance

###  Line Following Robot (Arduino)  
> FSM-based design with C++, SolidWorks prototyping, color sensor actions
> 
### ⚙ Independent Hardware Projects

###  Push Button SMS Alert 
>Raspberry Pi Pico W + Twilio API
>IoT project using the Raspberry Pi Pico W. I connected a simple push button to send SMS alerts through the Twilio API whenever it’s pressed. The system connects to Wi-Fi, and when the button is triggered, it sends a text message to a specified phone number.

###  AND & OR gate using BJTs and MOSFETs  
> Perfboard + PCB layout
>This project was all about understanding transistor logic and solidifying my grasp of circuit design.
>Skills: Soldering · Altium Designer · Electronic Circuit Design · Prototyping
